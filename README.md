# every-election-system
The ambitious goal is to provide a system for running, simulating, and explaining results of elections using any voting method and any ballot counting method

Current status is: initial implementation exists for several election systems.

Planned components:
- The election system models
  - Provide a wide variety of elections systems with detailed customization
- Ballot collection system
  - Send ballot tokens out via email
  - Allow ballots to be voted on a website
- Election result presentation system
  - Using appropriate visual aids, present results of elections in a way that can be understood by a layperson and serves to explain the election method
- Election simulation system
  - Provide a system for generating simulated ballot sets as an educational tool for exploring different election systems
